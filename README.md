Project description:

The project is made in html 5, which consists of three pages.
 
In the first is the history of photography and how it has evolved.

The second page is about the best video-only cameras, photo-only cameras, and the best cameras for both photos and videos.

The third page has a brief description of who I am and what I do.

How does the project work?

The project has a menu where you can see it and use it to navigate to the different pages. (The history of photography and how it has evolved, best cameras in each sector, about me)

Also each page will have anchors so you can scroll over the entire page
