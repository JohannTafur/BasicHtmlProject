            <p>
                Hello, I am Johan, a young man who is just beginning to live, who enjoys every moment of his life. 
                He is also looking for new skills. I have realized that I like photography, programming and going out 
                to see new beautiful places
            </p>

            <li><h1>Why do I like photography?</h1></li>
            <p>
                I really like photography, since in it I can be distracted and appreciate more the things that are around and we do not pay attention to it
            </p>

            <li><h1>Why did I choose programming?</h1></li>
            <p>
                I chose programming because from a very young age I liked everything that had to do with technology and I was 
                intrigued by how they worked. As I grew older, I investigated more deeply about this technological field and I 
                realized that you have many interesting branches, and the one that caught my attention the most was programming.
