            <p>
                The first photographic or heliographic procedure was invented by Niépce around 1824.
                The images were obtained with Judean bitumen, spread on a silver plate , after an exposure time of
                several days.
                In 1829, Niépce associates Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre in his research.
                In 1832, using the residue from the distillation of lavender essence, they perfected a second procedure
                that produced
                images with an exposure time of a whole day. <br>

                Niépce died in 1833. Daguerre continued to work alone and in 1838 invented the daguerreotype,
                the first procedure that included a development stage. A silver plate covered with a thin layer of
                silver iodide was
                exposed in a darkroom and then subjected to the action of mercury vapors that caused the appearance of
                an invisible latent image,
                formed during exposure to light.
                This development consisted of a great amplification of the effect of light, with which the exposure time
                did not exceed 30 minutes.
                The fixation was obtained by immersion in water, saturated with marine salts. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        In July 1839, another Frenchman, Hippolyte Bayard, discovered the means of obtaining positive
                        images directly on paper.
                        A silver chloride-coated paper was darkened in light and then exposed in a darkroom after being
                        impregnated with silver iodide.
                        Exposure time was thirty minutes to two hours. <br> <br>

                    <p>Still in 1839, the announcement of the invention of the daguerreotype prompted the Englishman
                        William Henry Fox
                        Talbot to resume the interrupted research whose beginnings dated back to 1834. In 1841, he
                        patented the calotype,
                        the first negative/positive procedure that allowed the multiplication of the same image thanks
                        to obtaining an
                        intermediate negative on a silver chloride paper, rendered translucent thanks to wax. As with
                        the daguerreotype,
                        the latent image was then developed by means of a chemical product, the developer: a solution of
                        gallic acid and silver nitrate.
                        A second sheet of paper also coated with silver chloride was later exposed through the
                        translucent negative, to give the final positive. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        In 1839 John Herschell is credited with discovering the means to fix images, immersing them in a
                        sodium hyposulfite bath,
                        the same essential component of current photographic fixers. The advantages of the calotype
                        rested mainly on the ease of
                        handling copies on paper and the possibility of multiple reproduction. In return, the
                        definition, limited by the presence
                        of the fibers of the negative paper, could not compete with the daguerreotype. <br> <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To further reduce the exposure time, short focal length lenses were created, which were
                        brighter,
                        therefore preserving sharpness throughout the image. In 1841, the physicist Fizeau replaced
                        silver iodide with silver
                        bromide, whose sensitivity to light is much higher. Nothing more than a few seconds of exposure
                        was enough to obtain
                        a daguerreotype. Then taking portraits became possible. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        In order to improve the transparency of the negative calotype, Abel Niépce de Saint Victor,
                        Niépce's cousin, discovered in 1847 the way to replace paper with glass . In order for silver
                        bromide to adhere to glass, he had the idea of ​​mixing it with albumen (the white of the egg).
                        Although somewhat contrasty, the images became extremely precise, forcing opticians to fine-tune
                        even more efficient lenses. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        In 1851, the Englishman Scott Archer replaced albumin with collodion, which is based on
                        guncotton.
                        The black and white images obtained by this procedure reached a quality never before obtained.
                        With
                        the drawback, that the shot had to take place while the plate was still wet and that the
                        development
                        had to be carried out immediately afterwards. <br> <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1871, another Briton, Richard Meaddox, remedied this problem by replacing collodion with
                        gelatin,
                        a procedure perfected by Charles Bennett who showed that gelatinized plates became highly
                        sensitive when kept
                        for several days at 32°C. Gelatin plates -bromide not only could they be stored before use, but
                        their sensitivity
                        was such that the exposure did not exceed a fraction of a second. <br>

                        For this reason, shortly before 1880, the history of the shutter began , because the high
                        sensitivity of
                        the plates required the conception of mechanisms capable of letting light into the camera for
                        only one
                        hundredth and even one thousandth of a second. The intensity of light had to be accurately
                        evaluated and thus
                        the photometer became a true measuring instrument. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Photography still lacked color reproduction. The first attempts were the initiative
                        of Edmond Becquerel in 1848, then that of Niépce de Saint Victor, in 1851, who
                        demonstrated that a silver plate coated with pure silver chloride reproduced colors
                        directly, although in an unstable manner. <br>

            <p>
                The basic concept of photography has been around since the 5th
                century BCE. C. This art was born in the 11th century when an Iraqi
                scientist developed something called "the camera obscura".
                Even then, the camera didn't actually record images, it just
                projected them onto another surface. The images were also upside
                down, although they could be traced to create accurate drawings
                of real objects such as buildings. <br>

                he first camera obscura used a hole in a tent to project an image
                from the outside of the tent into the dark area. It wasn't until
                the 17th century that the camera obscura became small enough to be
                portable. Basic lenses for focusing light were also introduced
                around this time. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Photography, as we know it today, began in the late 1830s in France.
                        Joseph Nicéphore Niépce used a portable camera obscura to expose a
                        bitumen-coated pewter plate to light. This is the first recorded
                        image that did not fade quickly.

                        Niépce's success led to a series of other experiments, and
                        photography progressed very rapidly. Daguerreotypes,
                        emulsion plates, and wet plates were developed almost simultaneously
                        in the mid to late 1800s.

                        With each type of emulsion, the photographers experimented with
                        different chemicals and techniques. The following are the three
                        that were instrumental in the development of modern photography:

                    <p>
                        Niépce's experiment led to a collaboration with Louis Daguerre.
                        The result was the creation of the daguerreotype, a precursor
                        to modern cinema. <br>

                        A copper plate was coated with silver and exposed to iodine
                        vapor before being exposed to light. <br>
                        To create the image on the plate, the first daguerreotypes
                        had to be exposed to light for up to 15 minutes. <br>
                        The daguerreotype was very popular until emulsion plates
                        replaced it in the late 1850s. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Emulsion plates, or wet plates, were less expensive than daguerreotypes 
                        and only required two to three seconds of exposure time. This made them 
                        much more suitable for portrait photography, which was the most common 
                        use of photography at the time. Many Civil War photographs were produced
                         on wet plates. <br>

                        These wet plates used an emulsion process called the collodion 
                        process, rather than a simple coating on the imaging plate. It 
                        was during this time that bellows were added to cameras to aid 
                        in focusing. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        In the 1870s, photography took another big step forward. Richard Maddox 
                        improved upon an earlier invention to make dry gelatin plates that were 
                        almost equal to wet plates in speed and quality. <br>

                        These dry plates could be stored instead of being manufactured on an 
                        as-needed basis. This gave photographers much more freedom in taking 
                        pictures. The process also allowed for smaller cameras that could be 
                        held in the hand. As exposure times decreased, the first camera with 
                        a mechanical shutter was developed. <br> <br>

                        At the same time that 35mm cameras were becoming popular, Polaroid 
                        introduced the Model 95. The Model 95 used a secret chemical process 
                        to develop the film inside the camera in less than a minute. <br>

T                       his new camera was quite expensive but the novelty of instant images 
                        caught the attention of the public. By the mid-1960s, Polaroid had 
                        many models on the market, and the price had come down so that even 
                        more people could afford it. <br> <br>

                        it easier for the photographer to control the image. In the 1950s, 
                        Asahi (which later became Pentax) introduced Asahiflex and Nikon 
                        introduced its Nikon F camera. Both were SLR-type cameras, and the 
                        Nikon F allowed for interchangeable lenses and other accessories. <br> <br>

                    <p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, compact cameras were introduced 
                        that were capable of making image control decisions on their own. 
                        These point-and-shoot cameras calculated shutter speed, aperture, 
                        and focus, allowing photographers to focus solely on composition.

                        In the 1980s and 1990s, various manufacturers worked on cameras that 
                        stored images electronically. The first were point-and-shoot cameras 
                        that used digital media instead of film. <br>

                        By 1991, Kodak had produced the first digital camera advanced 
                        enough to be used successfully by professionals. Other manufacturers 
                        quickly followed and today Canon, Nikon, Pentax offer digital reflex 
                        (DSLR) cameras. <br>

                        So far, we have shown you the evolution of photography. 
                        Compared to camera obscura or metal plates, we have definitely 
                        come a long way. We hope this brief synopsis motivates you to
