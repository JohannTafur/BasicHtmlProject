            <h2>History of photography</h2>
                <p>
                    The first photographic or heliographic procedure was invented by Niépce around 1824. 
                    The images were obtained with Judean bitumen, spread on a silver plate , after an exposure time of several days.
                    In 1829, Niépce associates Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre in his research.
                    In 1832, using the residue from the distillation of lavender essence, they perfected a second procedure that produced 
                    images with an exposure time of a whole day. <br>

                    Niépce died in 1833. Daguerre continued to work alone and in 1838 invented the daguerreotype, 
                    the first procedure that included a development stage. A silver plate covered with a thin layer of silver iodide was 
                    exposed in a darkroom and then subjected to the action of mercury vapors that caused the appearance of an invisible latent image, 
                    formed during exposure to light.
                    This development consisted of a great amplification of the effect of light, with which the exposure time did not exceed 30 minutes. 
                    The fixation was obtained by immersion in water, saturated with marine salts. <br> <br>

                        In July 1839, another Frenchman, Hippolyte Bayard, discovered the means of obtaining positive images directly on paper. 
                        A silver chloride-coated paper was darkened in light and then exposed in a darkroom after being impregnated with silver iodide. 
                        Exposure time was thirty minutes to two hours. <br> <br>

                    <p>Still in 1839, the announcement of the invention of the daguerreotype prompted the Englishman William Henry Fox 
                        Talbot to resume the interrupted research whose beginnings dated back to 1834. In 1841, he patented the calotype, 
                        the first negative/positive procedure that allowed the multiplication of the same image thanks to obtaining an 
                        intermediate negative on a silver chloride paper, rendered translucent thanks to wax. As with the daguerreotype, 
                        the latent image was then developed by means of a chemical product, the developer: a solution of gallic acid and silver nitrate. 
                        A second sheet of paper also coated with silver chloride was later exposed through the translucent negative, to give the final positive.
