            <h2>History of photography</h2>
                <p>
                    The first photographic or heliographic procedure was invented by Niépce around 1824. 
                    The images were obtained with Judean bitumen, spread on a silver plate , after an exposure time of several days.
                    In 1829, Niépce associates Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre in his research.
                    In 1832, using the residue from the distillation of lavender essence, they perfected a second procedure that produced 
                    images with an exposure time of a whole day. <br>

                    Niépce died in 1833. Daguerre continued to work alone and in 1838 invented the daguerreotype, 
                    the first procedure that included a development stage. A silver plate covered with a thin layer of silver iodide was 
                    exposed in a darkroom and then subjected to the action of mercury vapors that caused the appearance of an invisible latent image, 
                    formed during exposure to light.
                    This development consisted of a great amplification of the effect of light, with which the exposure time did not exceed 30 minutes. 
                    The fixation was obtained by immersion in water, saturated with marine salts. <br> <br>

                        In July 1839, another Frenchman, Hippolyte Bayard, discovered the means of obtaining positive images directly on paper. 
                        A silver chloride-coated paper was darkened in light and then exposed in a darkroom after being impregnated with silver iodide. 
                        Exposure time was thirty minutes to two hours. <br> <br>
