                The first photographic or heliographic procedure was invented by Niépce around 1824.
                The images were obtained with Judean bitumen, spread on a silver plate , after an exposure time of
                several days.
                In 1829, Niépce associates Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre in his research.
                In 1832, using the residue from the distillation of lavender essence, they perfected a second procedure
                that produced
                images with an exposure time of a whole day. <br>

                Niépce died in 1833. Daguerre continued to work alone and in 1838 invented the daguerreotype,
                the first procedure that included a development stage. A silver plate covered with a thin layer of
                silver iodide was
                exposed in a darkroom and then subjected to the action of mercury vapors that caused the appearance of
                an invisible latent image,
                formed during exposure to light.
                This development consisted of a great amplification of the effect of light, with which the exposure time
                did not exceed 30 minutes.
                The fixation was obtained by immersion in water, saturated with marine salts. <br> <br>

                        In July 1839, another Frenchman, Hippolyte Bayard, discovered the means of obtaining positive
                        images directly on paper.
                        A silver chloride-coated paper was darkened in light and then exposed in a darkroom after being
                        impregnated with silver iodide.
                        Exposure time was thirty minutes to two hours. <br> <br>

                    <p>Still in 1839, the announcement of the invention of the daguerreotype prompted the Englishman
                        William Henry Fox
                        Talbot to resume the interrupted research whose beginnings dated back to 1834. In 1841, he
                        patented the calotype,
                        the first negative/positive procedure that allowed the multiplication of the same image thanks
                        to obtaining an
                        intermediate negative on a silver chloride paper, rendered translucent thanks to wax. As with
                        the daguerreotype,
                        the latent image was then developed by means of a chemical product, the developer: a solution of
                        gallic acid and silver nitrate.
                        A second sheet of paper also coated with silver chloride was later exposed through the
                        translucent negative, to give the final positive. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        In 1839 John Herschell is credited with discovering the means to fix images, immersing them in a
                        sodium hyposulfite bath,
                        the same essential component of current photographic fixers. The advantages of the calotype
                        rested mainly on the ease of
                        handling copies on paper and the possibility of multiple reproduction. In return, the
                        definition, limited by the presence
                        of the fibers of the negative paper, could not compete with the daguerreotype. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        To further reduce the exposure time, short focal length lenses were created, which were
                        brighter,
                        therefore preserving sharpness throughout the image. In 1841, the physicist Fizeau replaced
                        silver iodide with silver
                        bromide, whose sensitivity to light is much higher. Nothing more than a few seconds of exposure
                        was enough to obtain
                        a daguerreotype. Then taking portraits became possible.
